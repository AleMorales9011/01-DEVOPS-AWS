Azure Databricks: Data Pipeline Deployment
In the realm of big data, machine learning algorithms require pre-processed data to perform calculations and generate meaningful results. Take, for example, a product or video recommendation algorithm. For it to function effectively, it must store and process vast amounts of user interaction data, such as viewed, saved, and liked products. This data is then compared in real-time with similar data from other users. By applying probabilistic algorithms, the system identifies common patterns and ultimately delivers personalized product recommendations to the user.
