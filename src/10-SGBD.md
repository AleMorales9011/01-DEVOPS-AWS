# Prerequisites

1. MySQL Community Server
2. MySQL Workbench

# Connecting Via CLI

The CLI(command line interface) provides a direct way to interact with the `database server`. 

```ruby
mysql -u root -p
```

# Modeling With MySql Workbench

MySQL Workbench offers a set of tools for modeling and `designing databases`.

# SQL Categories

In SQL, there are five main categories of commands, each serving a specific purpose in managing and interacting with databases. By understanding these different categories of SQL commands, you can effectively manage your database, ensuring proper `data structure`, manipulation, `security`, and retrieval capabilities.

# Transactions
Hereâ€™s an example of a transaction in SQL that includes all possible scenarios: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, and `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`. This transaction simulates a banking system where we perform a few account updates, use a savepoint, and handle an error that requires a rollback to a specific point.

```SQL
-- Start the transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Deduct $500 from Account A
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 'A';

-- Step 2: Set a SAVEPOINT after deducting from Account A
SAVEPOINT deduct_from_A;

-- Step 3: Add $500 to Account B
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 'B';

-- Step 4: Set another SAVEPOINT after adding to Account B
SAVEPOINT add_to_B;

-- Step 5: Check balances to validate transaction
SELECT account_id, balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id IN ('A', 'B');

-- Let's assume we find an issue here (e.g., Account B is overdrawn due to a previous transaction error),
-- so we decide to ROLLBACK to the savepoint where we had only deducted from Account A.

-- Step 6: Rollback to the savepoint after deducting from Account A
ROLLBACK TO deduct_from_A;

-- Step 7: Now, decide whether to commit the transaction (if everything is fine), or rollback the entire thing
-- In this case, let's assume we fix the issue and commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
